    "## what is es\n",
    "es is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database built on apache lucene.\n",
    "### what is es stack\n",
    "- ingest: fleet and elastic agent, application performance monitor, beats, elasticsearch ingest pipeline, logstash \n",
    "- store: index, store, search, analyze\n",
    "- consume: kibana, elasticsearch clients \n",
    "### search\n",
    "- full-text search: a fast, relevant full-text search solutions using inverted indexer, tokenization, and text analysis\n",
    "- vector database: store and search vectorized data, and create vector embeddings with build-in and third party nlp models. <i>please note the three terms in context of NLP (token, embedding, vector)</i>\n",
    "- semantic search: understand the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries using tools like synonyms, dense vector embeddings, and learned sparse query-document expansion \n",
    "- hybrid search: combine full-text search with vector search using state-of-the-art ranking algorithms. \n",
    "- build search experience. add hybrid search capabilities to apps or websites, or build enterprise search engines over org's internal data sources. \n",
    "- RAG: use es as rag engine to supplement generative AI models with more relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary data for a range of use cases.\n",
    "- geospatial search: search for locations and calculate spatial relationship using geospatial queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## run es\n",

    "### index\n",
    "an index is the fundamental unit of storage in es, a logic namespace for storing data that share similar characteristics. \n",
    "an index is a collection of docs uniquely identified by a name or an alias. \n",
    "### document and fields\n",
    "es serializes and stores data in the form of JSON docs. a doc is a set of fields, key-value pair that contain data. each doc has a unique id, which user can create or have es auto-generate\n",
    "### metadata fields\n",
    "an indexed doc contains data and metadata. metadata fields are system fields that store info about the docs. in es, metadata fields are prefixed with an underscore. \n",
    "### mappings and data types\n",
    "each <u>index</u> have a mapping or schema for how the fields in doc indexed. a mapping defines the data type for each field, how the field should be indexed, and how it should be stored. \n",
    "- dynamic mapping: let es automatically detect the data types and create mappings.\n",
    "- explicit mapping: define the mappings up front by specifying data types for each field. <u>recommended for prod</u> use cases, because you have full control over how your data is indexed to suit your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## add data to es\n",
    "### general content \n",
    "- use api to index doc, when dev app, use es client for different programming language\n",
